# Instructions

**IMPORTANT** : During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in this `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use this `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the big or/and little steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
    [x] sub task 
    [ ] sub task 
[ ] Task 2
[ ] Task 3

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.
